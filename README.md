Koin + Coroutines with MVVM in Kotlin

This repo is demonstrate how to develop Android app with good practices using Koin and Coroutines. The design patter that I use is MVVM. Why MVVM? because Google support it with the new LiveDataand ViewModel libraries. The app use thedogapi (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random) to show random images of dogs. It will show the list of dogs in MainActivity.
